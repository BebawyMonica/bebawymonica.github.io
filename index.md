 
#### A young, compassionate, ambitious and professional computer scientist 
I grew up in an upper class family in Egypt, moved to the United States when I was 15 years old. Graduated High School in 2013 with Honors. I started my undergraduate education at Azusa Pacific University in Computer Science and Mathematics in September 2013, and I am expected to graduate in May 2017. Not only am I passionate about Computer Science, but I am also passionate about music and arts. I started playing music instruments when I was four years old; I started playing the piano, and when I was eight I started playing the flute. I also enjoy sports, mainly soccer and volleyball. Reading and drawing are two things that I enjoy doing in my free time.
