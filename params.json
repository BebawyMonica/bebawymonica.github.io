  "body": "### Welcome to Monica Bebawy's Page\r\nI grow up in an upper class family in Egypt, moved to the United States when I was 15 years old. Graduated High School in 2013 with Honors. I started my undergraduate education at Azusa Pacific University in Computer Science and Mathematics in September 2013, and I am expected to graduate in May 2017. Not only am I passionate about Computer Science, but I am also passionate about music and arts. I started playing music instruments when I was four years old; I started playing the piano, and when I was eight I started playing the flute. I also enjoy sports, mainly soccer and volleyball. Reading and drawing are two things that I enjoy doing in my free time. \r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Contact Information \r\nEmail address: bebawymonica@gmail.com \r\n\r\nCell phone #: (951) 220-3404",
